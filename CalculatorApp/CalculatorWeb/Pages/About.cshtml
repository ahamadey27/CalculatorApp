<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
    This web application is a TDD-driven ASP.NET Core Razor Pages calculator, built in Visual Studio Code. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two decimal numbers. The project demonstrates robust software engineering practices by strictly following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring that all core logic is thoroughly tested using the xUnit framework before any production code is written.

<p>
    In addition to its core calculator functionality, the app integrates with a public currency API to dynamically populate a dropdown with world currencies. This showcases how to consume external RESTful services in ASP.NET Core, and how to design for maintainability and extensibility. The project emphasizes clean architecture, separation of concerns, and the use of dependency injection, making it a strong example of modern .NET web development best practices.
